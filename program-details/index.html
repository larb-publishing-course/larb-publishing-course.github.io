            <h2 id="dates">Dates:</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Sunday, June 25 – Friday, July 28*</strong></p>
            
            <p>* Students who register for the workshop commit to completing a series of
            preliminary exercises throughout the month of June before arriving.</p>
            
            <h2 id="schedule">Schedule:</h2>
            
            <p>The Workshop is a rigorous, intensive program; prospective applicants should
            expect to be working together on projects all day, every day that they are in
            Los Angeles, as well as attending classes, field trips, networking events, and
            social activities.</p>
            
            <p>A sample weekly schedule and enlisted faculty TBA—stay tuned!</p>
            
            <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility:</h2>
            
            <p>The program is open to both current students (rising junior students and above)
            and those who have already graduated (alumni of any college or university).</p>
            
            <h2 id="fellowships">Fellowships:</h2>
            
            <p>We hope to offer at least half of the seats in the course tuition-free, and
            another quarter at reduced tuition. If you would like to be considered for a
            fellowship, please review workshop costs below and then the fellowship
            guidelines and instructions on the application.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, each year the Los Angeles Review of Books will enroll free of
            charge two USC students or alumni, to be distinguished as the "LARB-USC
            fellows." If you are interested in this fellowship, please indicate so on
            the application.</p>
            
            <h2 id="workshop-costs">Workshop Costs</h2>
            
            <p><em>Tuition:</em></p>
            
            <p>Tuition for the Workshop is $5000 and covers all instruction, field trips, group
            activities, planned group dinners, et al. This cost does not cover any personal
            expenses incurred by participants.</p>
            
            <p>A deposit of $1500 is required to secure your spot once when you register for
            the program; the remainder is due no later than April 30, 2017.</p>
            
            <p>*All costs for housing, meals, and parking quoted below represent 2016 amounts.
            Amounts may change in the coming months and will be updated accordingly.</p>
            
            <p><em>Housing:</em></p>
            
            <p>The Workshop offers housing on the USC campus from June 24 – July 29 for a cost
            of $2166 for single occupancy (one person/ room) and $1786 for double occupancy
            (two people/ room).</p>
            
            <p>All housing comprises shared, air-conditioned suites, with four double rooms/
            suite (two people per room maximum) and bathroom facilities for each suite
            (suite-mates share bathroom facilities). A linen packet (pillow case, top and
            bottom bed sheets, 2 bath towels and facecloth) is provided along with pillow
            and blanket.</p>
            
            <p>Please indicate on your application whether or not you would like to reserve
            housing and which kind you would prefer (single or double).</p>
            
            <p>Payment for housing is due upon registration for the program and is
            non-refundable.</p>
            
            <p><em>Meals:</em></p>
            
            <p>Although a small number of group meals and other social activities will be
            included in the Workshop schedule, students are otherwise responsible for their
            own meals. The Workshop therefore offers a meal plan through USC. All meals are
            served buffet style in a food court.</p>
            
            <p>A payment for this meal plan is due by April 30, 2017 and is non-refundable.</p>
            
            <p>Breakfast: $8.72 per person; served from 7am to 10:30am</p>
            
            <p>Lunch: $11.99 per person; served from 11:00am to 3:30pm</p>
            
            <p>Dinner: $11.99 per person; served from 4:30pm to 7pm</p>
            
            <p><em>Parking:</em></p>

            to change without notice); no weekly parking available. The program directors
            will provide information for all registered participants about parking and other
            transportation options in the orientation materials students receive before the
            beginning of the program.</p>
