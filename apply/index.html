            <p>The <strong>Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Workshop</strong> is an
            experimental, collaborative, interdisciplinary laboratory preparing its students
            for the present and future of publishing and related fields. While we offer a
            standard curriculum to each year’s cohort, we also customize that curriculum
            according to the stated interests and background of the cohort chosen.</p>
            
            <p>We are therefore interested in knowing what areas most interest you and why,
            whether it is print or digital media, marketing, working as an agent or a
            designer, or innovating new publishing platforms that do not even yet exist.</p>
