## Application Guidelines:

_Admissions are on a rolling basis; to be considered for financial aid, your application must be in by April 15, 2016._

The **Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Course** is an experimental, collaborative, interdisciplinary laboratory preparing its students for the present and future of publishing and related fields. While we offer a standard curriculum to each year’s cohort, we also customize that curriculum according to the stated interests and background of the cohort chosen. 

We are therefore interested in knowing what areas most interest you and why, whether it is print or digital media, marketing, working as an agent or a designer, or innovating new publishing platforms that do not even yet exist. 

## Required Materials

- **Non-refundable application fee:** A $35 fee is required for all applicants (payable by credit card or US check). 
- **Personal Statement:** In 750 words or less, please describe your reasons for applying to the Los Angeles Review of Books USC Publishing Course, including any relevant experience that makes you particularly well suited for this program. 
- **Resume and Transcripts:** You will need to upload a PDF of your resume or CV, and if within 5 years of graduation, a PDF of your transcripts from the undergraduate and graduate institutions you have attended.
