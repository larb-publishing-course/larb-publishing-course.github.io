## Application Guidelines:

_Admissions are on a rolling basis; to be considered for financial aid, your application must be in by April 15, 2016._

The **Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Workshop ** is an experimental, collaborative, interdisciplinary laboratory preparing its students for the present and future of publishing and related fields. While we offer a standard curriculum to each yearâ€™s cohort, we also customize that curriculum according to the stated interests and background of the cohort chosen.

We are therefore interested in knowing what areas most interest you and why, whether it is print or digital media, marketing, working as an agent or a designer, or innovating new publishing platforms that do not even yet exist.
