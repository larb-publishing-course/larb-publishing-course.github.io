## Dates: 
**Sunday, June 26, 2016 – Friday, July 29, 2016***  
_* Students who register for the course commit to completing a series of
preliminary exercises throughout the month of June before arriving._

## Sample Schedule:

The Workshop is a rigorous, intensive program; prospective applicants should
expect to be working together on projects all day, every day that they are in
Los Angeles, as well as attending classes, field trips, networking events, and
social activities.

A sample weekly schedule and enlisted faculty TBA—stay tuned!

## Eligibility

The program is open to current students and alumni of any college or university,
not just USC, and will be hosted on the USC campus.

## Tuition:

Tuition for the Workshop is $5000 and covers all instruction, field trips, group
activities, planned group dinners, et al. This cost does not cover any personal
expenses incurred by participants.

A deposit of $1500 is required to secure your spot once when you register for
the program; the remainder is due no later than May 31, 2016.

## Housing:

The Workshop offers housing on the USC campus from June 25 – July 31 for a cost
of $2166 for single occupancy (one person/ room) and $1786 for double occupancy
(two people/ room).

All housing comprises shared, air-conditioned suites, with four double rooms/
suite (two people per room maximum) and bathroom facilities for each suite
(suite-mates share bathroom facilities).  A linen packet (pillow case, top and
bottom bed sheets, 2 bath towels and facecloth) is provided along with pillow
and blanket.

Please indicate on your application whether or not you would like to reserve
housing and which kind you would prefer (single or double).

Payment for housing is due upon registration for the program and is
non-refundable.

## Meals:

Although a small number of group meals and other social activities will be
included in the Workshop schedule, students are otherwise responsible for their
own meals. The Workshop therefore offers a meal plan through USC. All meals are
served buffet style in a food court.
 
A payment for this meal plan is due by May 31 and is non-refundable.

> Breakfast: $8.72 per person; served from 7am to 10:30am  
> Lunch: $11.99 per person; served from 11:00am to 3:30pm  
> Dinner: $11.99 per person; served from 4:30pm to 7pm  

## Parking:

Parking passes are available at USC for $12.00/ day (Summer 2016 rates; subject
to change without notice); no weekly parking available. The program directors
will provide information for all registered participants about parking and other
transportation options in the orientation materials students receive before the
beginning of the program.

## Scholarships:

Each year the Los Angeles Review of Books will enroll free of charge two USC
students or alumni, to be distinguished as the “LARB-USC fellows.” In addition,
LARB offers two scholarships for applicants not affiliated with USC. If you
would like to be considered for a scholarship, please indicate which scholarship
on the application, and include a statement of no more than 300 words explaining
your reasons for requesting it.
