## Overview

The Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Workshop is an immersive,
collaborative publishing program designed for students and innovators interested
in playing a role in the future of publishing. This holistic training course
equips participants with skills in both digital and print publishing and is
unique among publishing courses in its focus on producing live ventures by the
summer’s end. The Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Workshop is a
vanguard, real-world program whose graduates will go on to be among the most
well-trained, experienced, competitive, and inventive in the industry.

The Workshop gives participants a foundation in both traditional and future
platforms, as they attend lectures, seminars, and boot camps in book, magazine,
and online editing; digital and print publishing; SEO and audience metrics; and
the financial and business side of publishing. Participants will learn from a
broad selection of experts who specialize in various aspects of the publishing
industry, including editors, art directors, book historians, literary agents,
marketing professionals, published writers, academic publishers, web coders,
developers, and digital innovators. The signature project of the Workshop is a
real world, hands-on practicum: the creation of a print magazine or website, or
the development of a business plan for a new publishing enterprise that is ready
either for direct funding or for research and development funding.

Participants interested in print publishing will participate in staffing and
co-publishing an annual Workshop print edition which features original content
participants acquire, curate, and edit specifically for the publication. This
publication, to be named and branded by Workshop participants, is both an online
Los Angeles Review of Books Channel and a print edition, distributed in Los
Angeles and shipped to LARB Members.

Participants will collaborate in cohorts, each of which will also generate a new
publishing project and develop a business plan and funding proposal for that
project. These participants will work with program faculty and visiting industry
experts to bring those projects into being, receiving the instruction they need
and training in the tools and skillsets necessary to achieve real-world results.
By the end of the Workshop, participants will have participated in producing a
viable publication or proposal, using the expertise they developed.

Participants will be in residence at USC for five weeks, from **June 26 – July 29,**
committing to a series of preparatory assignments before arriving in Los
Angeles.
